# GOAL - we wanna save the entry station
# Where doo we get the station? "station"
# Where do we store the station? @entry_station
# at touch_in set @entry_station to "station"
# at touch_out set @entry_station to nil
# What is our double?

# Goal - refactor in_journey 
# in_journey relies on entry station

# !!nil   #=> false
# !!"abc" #=> true
# !!false #=> false
